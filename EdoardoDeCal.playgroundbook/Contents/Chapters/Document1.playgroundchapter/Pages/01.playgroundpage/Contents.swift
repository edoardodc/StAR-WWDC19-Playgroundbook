Welcome! This playground book teaches you about the universe by having you connect stars to form constellations. 
 
 **A few tips to make the most of this playground experience:**
 1. Allow camera permissions. We need your camera to show you the universe.
 2. Find a big empty surface to place your scene on. Make sure there’s enough light.
 3. Tap the blue star and start connecting the stars. When you’re done, tap the white label to get to know more about the constellation you just discovered.

 Having trouble detecting planes? Move your iPad on a room bright.

 
 Have fun!
